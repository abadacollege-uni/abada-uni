            <p class="title">A Brief History of ABADA COLLEGE</p>
            <p class="meaning">
              The Abada College (formerly known as Abada Memorial College) for the past fifty-four years, has established for her the marks of genuine, selfless, and intelligent service to humanity in this island
              
              province of Oriental Mindoro.
              
              Tracing her beginning on April 26, 1950 when a group of civic spirited persons conceived of putting up in the heart of Pinamalayan an institution of higher learning, the ABADA COLLEGE since then, has continued to her commitment of dedicated service to the people of the community for them to cope with the complex demands of the present age and society. Among the energetic founders of this educational institution were the late Ex. Congressman Conrado
              
              Morente, Mr. Enrique Morente, Sr., Mr. Tomas Goco, Mrs. Purification Morente-Abada, Dr. and Mrs. Prisco de Joya, Mrs. Natividad de Joya, Mrs. Lourdes Lavares-Goco, Mr. Pedro Caballero, and Mr. Pedro Nable. Beginning June 1950, the Abada College offered the elementary, secondary, and normal courses and conducted classes in a leased building situated near the Pinamalayan Park. When typhoon "Wanda" in December 1950 swept down this building, the school was transferred to another building leased by
              
              Mrs. Purificacion Abada located on the corner of Morente and Mabini Streets. The school operated there
              
              until 1963-1964 school year. In order to accommodate more students and to provide better educational facilities, the Abada College in 1962 purchased 7,335 sq.m. of land area from Mr. Juan Abarquez and another one (1) hectare fron Dr. Prisco de Joya and Mrs. Natividad de Joya who also donated % hectare at Marfrancisco, this town aside from their dipping into their own pockets to tide things over. With the newly acquired school site, the Abada College was not only able to erect buildings but also provided a spacious playground for her growing school community. Beginning 1964-1965 school year, the Abada College conducted classes in her own buildings in Marfrancisco. Since then, her progress has been steady.
              
              Ex Congressman Conrado Morente headed this institution of higher learning as President and concurrently Chairman of the Board of Trustees until 1972 when he was succeeded by Atty. Manuel Morente, Sr. due to his untimely demise on April 5, 1972. Mr. Enrique Morente was the first Director of the College until his death on December 30, 1969. Through a resolution by the Board of Trustees, the position for Director was abolished, in its stead was created the position for Administrator with Atty. Armando D. Ansaldo occupying the position. Atty, Manuel Morente, Sr. presidency ended in 1989 when he was elected Municipal Mayor of
              
              Pinamalayan. His position has been occupied by Atty. Miguel D. Ansaldo, Jr., a brilliant lawyer and one of
              
              the most sought trial lawyers in the region if not in the entire Philippines. With his vision for the school and
              
              his decisiveness plus the all-out support of the new Board of Trustees composed of young, energetic,
              
              dynamic and visionary men and women committed to continue the legacy passed on to them by their
              
              parents and grandparents, Abada College has emerged as one of the leading higher institutions of learning
              
              in the province (region?)
              
              With almost a decade and a half, Abada College under her new leadership has undergone and has been undergoing tremendous changes. Old buildings were demolished. New buildings were erected. The only remnants of the past are the
              
              old stage, the home economics building, and the flat building between the new three-storey college edifice and the two-storey high school building. On the northernmost part of the campus is the new Abada College Gymnasium, the biggest in Oriental Mindoro has become functional three years ago. The newly con- structed two-level structure in the campus houses the student's lounge, the canteen, the office of the College Student Council, the office of the College Security, and the Powerhouse - all on the first level. On the second level is the College Laboratory adjacent to the library. The campus which for a long time past has been mistakenly thought to be a pasture land is now enclosed with a high rise-cemented fence. Offices were renovated and made spacious and fully-air conditioned.
              
              These phenomenal changes are not limited to the visible physical improvements but likewise in the various fields in academic expansion. New courses are opened such as Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim), Bachelor of Science in Public Administration (BSPA), Midwifery, Associate in Computer Technology (ACT), Associate in Office Management (AOM), Asso- ciate in Computer Science (ACS). So with major fields of specialization are also opened for Bachelor of Elementary Education and Bachelor of Secondary Education, among others Science, Mathematics, Fili- pino, Social Studies and for Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Accounting Management is also added. All of these have transpired under the tireless efforts of Dr. Iluminada M. Martin, the College Academic Dean and concurrently Principal of the High School Department.

              Air-conditioned computer laboratory, midwifery laboratory, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology labora- tory, a firing range for criminology students, books for library use, and qualified faculty are all provided for the new courses offered to meet the requirements of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). Most importantly, under President Miguel D. Ansaldo Jr. and the present members of the Board of
              
              Trustees, the welfare of all Abada College employees is well taken cared of...a motivating factor for commit-
              
              ted, efficient, dedicated and loyal service. Commitment, Efficiency, Loyalty: the keys to ABADA COLLEGE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE!
